	            <p>I was immediately drawn to this book by its title, as -I'm not quite sure the degree of "accidentalness"- I've somehow been apparently a 
			    practicing Shaman since the age of 10. I had lower/middle-class, European parents, and zero exposure to anything moderately religious 
			    except for my mother's feeble introduction to Catholicism. It took me literally no time at all to realize, as a child, that I didn't
			    believe a word of any of it, and understood that my place was outside of, or perhaps beyond, the confines of organized religion. I feel 
			    like many of us have had the same sort of feelings and experiences that lead us to the "seeker's path". (Need like 3 more sentences here, 
			    segue into the actual book) He is super anti-authoritarian, and at times can infuse a little too much piss and vinegar into his wording. 
			    Honestly, I find this refreshing, as I'm getting tired of everyone mincing words for the sake of diplomacy. I also think this provides a 
			    novel perspective contradictive of the Shaman of yore- the most peaceful old man in the village, sitting in his deer skin tent with nothing 
			    but the knowledge of all galaxies...</p>

	           <!-- <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#2. Creative WordPress Themes</h2> -->
	            <p>Howard Charing wrote this book as this lovely synthesis of the history that led to his adoption of Shamanic practice with just enough insights 
			    into his uniquely Shamanic experiences that occur during practice. It made me go "holy shit, I do that too" several times during the read. 
			    And I was just ecstatic about it. The more I read from other practitioners, the happier it makes me that there are these shared 
			    occurrences- that I'm not sure any of us actually are able to learn by our own volition from any one or any thing.</p>
				
			<p>Charing's account of his elevator accident was terrifying. It seems that most who are led to this pursuit do so after suffering 
			    some sort of serious life event or setback, whether it is a physical accident, tragedy, or even a period of temporary insanity or 
			    psychosis. I think there is some latent survival mode that kicks into spiritual advancement-overdrive when such things happen, 
			    forcing us to either sink or swim; the Universe is literally saying "you <strong>will</strong> heal, and then you will heal others, or else". 
		      I think most of us need a swift and cosmic kick in the ass to wake up. Howard's book spends a good deal of time explaining his transition: regular guy, 
		      accident, Shaman. If you are looking for an unabridged encyclopedia of Shamanic practice, this is not it. He spends <em>just </em> enough time 
		      explaining core concepts like Soul Retrieval and the "Three Worlds", and delves probably a little too far into what I like to call "reality studies".
		      But then again, this is more of an anecdotal book; not so much a how-to manual.</p>
		      
		      
			
		      <p>Regarding those who want to learn Shamanic practice to help themselves or potentially others, he does offer sporadic exercises that are actually very 
		      helpful for beginners. The biggest smile came over my face when I came to the exercise that teaches how to perceive one's own etheric field (the smaller, 
		      base layer of the aura closest to the skin). He calls it "fuzzy energy", referring to how he initially saw it before learning the more formal 
		      terminology of energy fields and auras. The exercise entails rubbing one's hands together, as if one is plotting a train heist and is nefariously 
		      excited about it, and then moving them apart, back together but not quite touching, further apart, back together, etc. The goal is to feel something
		      between your hands that is akin to pushing two magnets together with the same poles facing (i.e. positive towards positive). There should be a soft 
		      resistance eventually, anti-magnetic, if you will, and a sensation of maybe buzzing or vibration. For those who are visually-gifted, the "fuzzy lines" 
		      might even show up between the hands. They're somewhat hard to miss if you do see them, as it looks like there is a desert mirage all of a sudden coming 
		      off of your hand, or the wavy heat lines coming off of a hot car in the summer. The density of your own energy, once you see it, is surprising, 
		      and will distort the background. It's pretty neat.</p>
	            <p>
	              <img src="images/desertmirage.jpg" alt="Toasty out there" class="img-fluid">
	            </p>
	            <p>That very exercise is something I discovered in early high school, pre-internet, and for the life of me I can't remember what dilapidated book 
			    from the 80s I found it in. That exercise gave such immediate gratification of being able to sense my own energy field and has led to everything 
			    I know how to do now. I'm not sure about anybody else, but that sensation can be called at will around my entire body at any time. Sometimes it 
			    just stays that way, and the sensation only goes away when I'm completely engrossed in something else. Really the only time I care about 
			    shutting it off is when I'm purposely closing my energy off (lots of people around, or maybe one super negative-Nancy).</p>

		      <p>As part of the subtitle of the book is "Journeys with Plant Teachers", I can't avoid the heavy emphasis Charing places on his Ayahuasca usage 
			throughout the book. He spends a good deal of time detailing more of his "bad trips" and what to be wary of when traveling (especially solo) to a completely isolated part
			      of the Amazonian jungle to "see God". I had hoped that as pro-plant as he is, he would have spent more time convincing the reader as to its relative
			      safety and outlining some of the "over 200" amazing experiences he has had. Sadly, this was not the case, and I feel like I must throw my 2 cents 
			      (adjusted for inflation) towards the topic. Take it as you will.</p>
			<p>I feel like the mind is increasingly fragile when one is searching for answers... personally I've seen the desperation in people who 
			      have spent thousands of dollars to go have a trip with a stranger and trust them to take care of their uncontrolled bodily functions while they are 
			      "communing with the universe" and "opening their consciousness". It's too easy to literally break the mind and lose grip of reality when one is not firmly grounded (and most of these people don't, as most are looking for a quick 
			      fix for enlightenment). The conscious mind is locked up and put away in a closet, and the subconscious is allowed to run amuck willy nilly. 
			      There must be a balance between the two, or else psychosis ensues. Those who I have observed who a) do not have their own well-established spiritual practice and b) are ayahuasca fan-boys/girls do become increasingly 
			      more spacey and most conversation with them seems to focus primarily on the topic of ayahuasca, as if it has become them.
			The only time I would condone the use of ayahuasca or any other alternate-reality-inducing substance is when it is taken by an advanced and relatively sage practitioner. 
			      However, most at that stage can induce an altered state at will or by some other means not involving the ingestion/inhalation of some substance, 
			      and understand that those external substances are absolutely not needed to achieve altered states and to communicate with those on other frequencies.</p>

			<p>Let me hop down off my soapbox... <br>The only practical exercise Charing included of which I was <strong>really</strong> not a fan involved what he referred to as accessing the "prebirth existence". 
				The exercise is more or less a remote-viewing session to the moment of one's own conception. Now, I'm not sure about you, but that is literally 
				the last thing I ever want to experience. He wants us to place our consciousness into the sperm, and then into the egg... then analyze how the 
				father is feeling, what is he seeing; then the mother... If that doesn't bother you, then that's awesome and I absolutely invite you to try it. 
				Also, Howard may not have considered a conception that occurred outside of a nice, loving relationship. I'm not sure how healing and therapeutic 
				it would be to bear witness to one's biological father wondering how much money he needs to leave on the nightstand.</p>

			<p>The accessibility of this book makes it one of my top recommendations for those who are curious about Shamanism or are just starting out in the journey. 
				Hell, even if you've been doing it for 50 years, I still think it's worth the read. It de-mystifies the subject enough to provide a decent foundation 
				for more advanced reading. --as long as one keeps one's perspective regarding synthetically-attained altered states-- I feel like Howard writes like 
				he talks, like someone sat and held a tape recorder in front of him for a few hours and then transcribed the result. I appreciate that kind of 
				textual honesty and unpretentiousness.</p>
